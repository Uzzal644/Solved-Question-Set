## 1. a) How is interface different from abstract class? Explain the use of interface to achieve multiple inheritances.

Ans:
Abstract class | Interface
---------------|----------
Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods. From Java 8, it can have default and static methods also | Interface can have only abstract methods.
An abstract class may contain non-final variables | Variables declared in a Java interface are by default final.
Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables |  Interface has only static and final variables.
Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface. | Interface can’t provide the implementation of abstract class
Abstract class can be extended using keyword “extends” | A Java interface can be implemented using keyword “implements”
an abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces. | An interface can extend another Java interface only
A Java abstract class can have class members like private, protected, etc. | Members of a Java interface are public by default.

An interface contains variables and methods like a class but the methods in an interface are abstract by default unlike a class. Multiple inheritance by interface occurs if a class implements multiple interfaces or also if an interface itself extends multiple interfaces.
Since java does not support multiple inheritance in case of class, but by using interface it can achieve multiple inheritance .It is used to achieve total abstraction.

## 1. b) What are the uses of abstract keyword? Explain with a suitable program.

Ans: The abstract keyword is used to achieve abstraction in Java. It is a non-access modifier which is used to create abstract class and method.

The role of an abstract class is to contain abstract methods. However, it may also contain non-abstract methods. The method which is declared with abstract keyword and doesn't have any implementation is known as an abstract method.
Example:

```javascript
abstract class Vehicle  
{  
    abstract void bike();  
      
}  
class Honda extends Vehicle  
{  
  
    @Override  
    void bike() {  
        System.out.println("Bike is running");  
      
    }  
      
}  
  
public class AbstractExample1 {  
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
  
    Honda obj=new Honda();  
    obj.bike();  
    }         
} 
```

## 2. a) Create a class Employee with id, name, post and salary. Create a parameterized constructor to initialize the instance variables. Override the to String() method to display the employee details.

Ans:

```javascript
public class Employee {

    String name,post;
    int id,salary;
    Employee(int id,String name,String post,int salary)
    {
        this.id=id;
        this.name=name;
        this.post=post;
        this.salary=salary;
    }
    public String toString(){//overriding the toString() method
        return "ID "+id+" Name:"+name+" Post:"+post+" Salary:"+ salary;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee obj1=new Employee(10,"ajay","manager",15200);
        Employee obj2=new Employee(15,"Divya","Assistant",80000);
        System.out.println(obj1);//compiler writes here s1.toString()
        System.out.println(obj2);
    }
}
```

```javascript
Output:

ID 10 Name:ajay Post:manager Salary:15200
ID 15 Name:Divya Post:Assistant Salary:80000
```

## 2. b) What is exception handling? Explain. Write a program to handle Arithmetic Exception.

Ans: The Exception Handling in Java is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors so that normal flow of the application can be maintained.
There are mainly two types of exceptions: checked and unchecked. Here, an error is considered as the unchecked exception. According to Oracle, there are three types of exceptions:

- Checked Exception
- Unchecked Exception
- Error

![Hierarchy of exception](https://static.javatpoint.com/images/throwable.png)

Example:
```javascript
class Example1
{
   public static void main(String args[])
   {
      try{
         int num1=30, num2=0;
         int output=num1/num2;
         System.out.println ("Result: "+output);
      }
      catch(ArithmeticException e){
         System.out.println ("You Shouldn't divide a number by zero");
      }
   }
}
```

## 3. a)What is a dialog box? Explain its types. Write a program to create your own dialog box.

Ans: The dialog box is a graphical control element in the form of a small window that communicates information to the user and prompts them for a response.The JOptionPane is a subclass of JComponent class which includes static methods for creating and customizing modal dialog boxes using a simple code.
JOptionPane class is used to display four types of dialog boxes:

- MessageDialog -  dialog box that displays a message making it possible to add icons to alert the user.
- ConfirmDialog  -  dialog box that besides sending a message, enables the user to answer a question.
- InputDialog       -  dialog box that besides sending a message, allows entry of a text.
- OptionDialog    -  dialog box that covers the three previous types.

```javascript
import javax.swing.*;  
public class OptionPaneExample {  
JFrame f;  
OptionPaneExample(){  
    f=new JFrame();  
    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(f,"Hello, Welcome to Javatpoint.");  
}  
public static void main(String[] args) {  
    new OptionPaneExample();  
}  
}  
```

## 3. b) What are the different types of streams supported by java? Explain. A data file "emp.txt" contains name, address and salary of 30 employees. Write a program to display only those records who are from "Kathmandu".

Ans: //// not added//

## 4. a) Create a swing GUI that contains a two buttons (add and subtract) and three text fields. When the buttons are clicked sum or difference of values of first two text fields should be displayed in the third text field respectively.

Ans:

```javascript
import javax.swing.*;  
import java.awt.event.*;  
public class TextFieldExample implements ActionListener{  
    JTextField tf1,tf2,tf3;  
    JButton b1,b2;  
    TextFieldExample(){  
        JFrame f= new JFrame();  
        tf1=new JTextField();  
        tf1.setBounds(50,50,150,20);  
        tf2=new JTextField();  
        tf2.setBounds(50,100,150,20);  
        tf3=new JTextField();  
        tf3.setBounds(50,150,150,20);  
        tf3.setEditable(false);   
        b1=new JButton("+");  
        b1.setBounds(50,200,50,50);  
        b2=new JButton("-");  
        b2.setBounds(120,200,50,50);  
        b1.addActionListener(this);  
        b2.addActionListener(this);  
        f.add(tf1);f.add(tf2);f.add(tf3);f.add(b1);f.add(b2);  
        f.setSize(300,300);  
        f.setLayout(null);  
        f.setVisible(true);  
    }
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {  
        String s1=tf1.getText();  
        String s2=tf2.getText();  
        int a=Integer.parseInt(s1);  
        int b=Integer.parseInt(s2);  
        int c=0;  
        if(e.getSource()==b1){  
            c=a+b;  
        }else if(e.getSource()==b2){  
            c=a-b;  
        }  
        String result=String.valueOf(c);  
        tf3.setText(result);  
    }  
public static void main(String[] args) {  
    new TextFieldExample();  
} }  
```

## 4. b) Explain the use of URL and URL Connection class with a suitable program.

Ans:

## 5. a) ) Write a program to display ali records from the database table. Assume the name of database and table yourself.

Ans:

## 5. b)Differentiate between TCP and UDP. Create a TCP client application that takes input from user and sends it to the server.

Ans:
TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL (TCP) | USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL (UDP)
------------------------------------|-----------------------------
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. Connection-orientation means that the communicating devices should establish a connection before transmitting data and should close the connection after transmitting the data. | UDP is the Datagram oriented protocol. This is because there is no overhead for opening a connection, maintaining a connection, and terminating a connection. UDP is efficient for broadcast and multicast type of network transmission.
TCP is reliable as it guarantees delivery of data to the destination router. | The delivery of data to the destination cannot be guaranteed in UDP.
TCP provides extensive error checking mechanisms. It is because it provides flow control and acknowledgment of data. | UDP has only the basic error checking mechanism using checksums.
Sequencing of data is a feature of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). this means that packets arrive in-order at the receiver. | There is no sequencing of data in UDP. If ordering is required, it has to be managed by the application layer.
TCP is comparatively slower than UDP. | UDP is faster, simpler and more efficient than TCP.
Retransmission of lost packets is possible in TCP, but not in UDP. | There is no retransmission of lost packets in User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
TCP has a (20-80) bytes variable length header. | UDP has a 8 bytes fixed length header.
TCP is heavy-weight. | UDP is lightweight.
TCP doesn’t supports Broadcasting. | UDP supports Broadcasting.

## 6. a)How is applet different from normal java program? List out the steps for converting applet into application.

Ans: Applets are small programs that are designed to execute in web browsers to generate dynamic content.

## 6. b) How can you create closable frames in swing and AWT? Write a program to draw a bar chart.

Ans:

## 7. Short notes on:

### 1. Reflection API

Reflection is an API which is used to examine or modify the behavior of methods, classes, interfaces at runtime.

- The required classes for reflection are provided under java.lang.reflect package.
- Reflection gives us information about the class to which an object belongs and also the methods of that class which can be executed by using the object.
- Through reflection we can invoke methods at runtime irrespective of the access specifier used with them.

![Reflection API](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/reflection.png)

Reflection can be used to get information about –

- Class The getClass() method is used to get the name of the class to which an object belongs.
- Constructors The getConstructors() method is used to get the public constructors of the class to which an object belongs.
- Methods The getMethods() method is used to get the public methods of the class to which an objects belongs

### 2. History of Java

1) James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers called Green Team.

2) Initially designed for small, embedded systems in electronic appliances like set-top boxes.

3) Firstly, it was called "Greentalk" by James Gosling, and the file extension was .gt.

4) After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project.

Why Java named "Oak"?

1) Why Oak? Oak is a symbol of strength and chosen as a national tree of many countries like the U.S.A., France, Germany, Romania, etc.

2) In 1995, Oak was renamed as "Java" because it was already a trademark by Oak Technologies.

Why Java Programming named "Java"?
7) Why had they chosen java name for Java language? The team gathered to choose a new name. The suggested words were "dynamic", "revolutionary", "Silk", "jolt", "DNA", etc. They wanted something that reflected the essence of the technology: revolutionary, dynamic, lively, cool, unique, and easy to spell and fun to say.

According to James Gosling, "Java was one of the top choices along with Silk". Since Java was so unique, most of the team members preferred Java than other names.

8) Java is an island of Indonesia where the first coffee was produced (called java coffee). It is a kind of espresso bean. Java name was chosen by James Gosling while having coffee near his office.

9) Notice that Java is just a name, not an acronym.

10) Initially developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which is now a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995.

11) In 1995, Time magazine called Java one of the Ten Best Products of 1995.

12) JDK 1.0 released in(January 23, 1996). After the first release of Java, there have been many additional features added to the language. Now Java is being used in Windows applications, Web applications, enterprise applications, mobile applications, cards, etc. Each new version adds the new features in Java.
