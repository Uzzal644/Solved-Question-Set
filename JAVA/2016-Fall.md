# 2016-Fall

## 1. a) How does Java support re-usability? Provide examples.

Ans:

## 1. b) Discuss about the concept of instance variable hiding in Java.Illustrate with a code example.

Ans:

## 2. a)Make a class Human with a name and age. Make a class Employee inherit from Human. Add instance variable salary of type double. Supply a method showData() that prints the Employee's name, age, and salary. Make a class Manager inherit from Employee.Supply appropriate showData() methods for all classes. Provide a test program that tests these classes and methods

Ans:

```javascript

```

## 2. b) Why is exception handling essential? Differentiate between checked and unchecked exceptionsiwith relevant examples.

Ans:

Checked Exception | Unchecked Exception
------------------|--------------------
Checked exceptions occur at compile time. | Unchecked exceptions occur at runtime.
The compiler checks a checked exception. | The compiler does not check these types of exceptions.
These types of exceptions can be handled at the time of compilation. | These types of exceptions cannot be a catch or handle at the time of compilation, because they get generated by the mistakes in the program.
They are the sub-class of the exception class. | They are runtime exceptions and hence are not a part of the Exception class.
Here, the JVM needs the exception to catch and handle. | Here, the JVM does not require the exception to catch and handle.
Examples of Checked exceptions:

- File Not Found Exception
- No Such Field Exception
- Interrupted Exception
- No Such Method Exception
- Class Not Found Exception
 | Examples of Unchecked Exceptions:
- No Such Element Exception
- Undeclared Throwable Exception
- Empty Stack Exception
- Arithmetic Exception
- Null Pointer Exception
- Array Index Out of Bounds Exception
- Security Exception
  
## 3. a) Discuss about the life cycle of an Applet.

Ans:

![life cyle of applet](https://www.startertutorials.com/corejava/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/applet-life-cycle.png)

As shown in the above diagram, the life cycle of an applet starts with init() method and ends with destroy() method. Other life cycle methods are start(), stop() and paint(). The methods to execute only once in the applet life cycle are init() and destroy(). Other methods execute multiple times.

- init(): The init() method is the first method to execute when the applet is executed. Variable declaration and initialization operations are performed in this method.

- start(): The start() method contains the actual code of the applet that should run. The start() method executes immediately after the init() method. It also executes whenever the applet is restored, maximized or moving from one tab to another tab in the browser.

- stop(): The stop() method stops the execution of the applet. The stop() method executes when the applet is minimized or when moving from one tab to another in the browser.

- destroy(): The destroy() method executes when the applet window is closed or when the tab containing the webpage is closed. stop() method executes just before when destroy() method is invoked. The destroy() method removes the applet object from memory.

- paint(): The paint() method is used to redraw the output on the applet display area. The paint() method executes after the execution of start() method and whenever the applet or browser is resized.

Simple code to illustrate life cycle of applet:

```javascript
import java.awt.*;
import java.applet.*;
public class MyApplet extends Applet 
{
	public void init()
	{
		System.out.println("Applet initialized");
	}
	public void start()
	{
		System.out.println("Applet execution started");
	}
	public void stop()
	{
		System.out.println("Applet execution stopped");
	}
	public void paint(Graphics g)
	{
		System.out.println("Painting...");
	}
	public void destroy()
	{
		System.out.println("Applet destroyed");
	}
}
```

## 3. b)Write an Applet program to illustrate the message sharing between HTML and Applets.

Ans: //// not added//

## 3. d) Differentiate between Panel and Frame.

Ans:

![panel vs frame](https://pediaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Difference-Between-Panel-and-Frame-in-Java-Comparison-Summary-677x1024.jpg)

## 4. a)Write a program to generate a Frame with two buttons "BLACK" and "BLUE". When a button is clicked it should change the background color of the Frame to respective color.

Ans:

## 4. b) ) Write a Java Program to draw a 2D rectangle in green color. Next draw the flag of Nepal inside the rectangle. Write a string "MY NEPAL" below the rectangle.

Ans:

## 5. a) What is a socket? Differentiate between datagram and stream communication.

Ans:

## 5. b) Write the steps to create a client server program. Provide code snippet to for each steps.

Ans:

## 6. a) What pis a ResultSetMetadata. Provide a simple example code to illustrate its usage.

Ans:

## 6. b) Discuss about the different types of database drivers

Ans: There are 4 types of JDBC drivers:

- Type-1 driver or JDBC-ODBC bridge driver

  Type-1 driver or JDBC-ODBC bridge driver uses ODBC driver to connect to the database. The JDBC-ODBC bridge driver converts JDBC method calls into the ODBC function calls. Type-1 driver is also called Universal driver because it can be used to connect to any of the databases.

- Type-2 driver or Native-API driver

The Native API driver uses the client -side libraries of the database. This driver converts JDBC method calls into native calls of the database API. In order to interact with different database, this driver needs their local API, thatâ€™s why data transfer is much more secure as compared to type-1 driver.

- Type-3 driver or Network Protocol driver

The Network Protocol driver uses middleware (application server) that converts JDBC calls directly or indirectly into the vendor-specific database protocol. Here all the database connectivity drivers are present in a single server, hence no need of individual client-side installation.

- Type-4 driver or Thin driver

Type-4 driver is also called native protocol driver. This driver interact directly with database. It does not require any native database library, that is why it is also known as Thin Driver
