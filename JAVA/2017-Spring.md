## 1. a) Define Java as Platform Independent Programming Language.

Ans: The meaning of platform-independent is that the java compiled code(byte code) can run on all operating systems.
Java compiler produces a unique type of code called bytecode unlike c compiler where compiler produces only natively executable code for a particular machine.
When the Java program runs in a particular machine it is sent to java compiler, which converts this code into intermediate code called bytecode. These bytecodes generated by the compiled program are to achieve the purpose of platform independency. Byte code generated in a particular platform can be executed in any other platform i.e. the byte code generated in windows OS can also be executed in Unix OS. The one which makes this possible is the JVM (JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE).This bytecode is sent to Java virtual machine (JVM) which resides in the RAM of any operating system. JVM recognizes the platform it is on and converts the bytecodes into native machine code which is readable by a particular machine. Hence java is called platform independent language.

## 1. b) What is constructor, Explain with example?

Ans: A constructor is a block of codes similar to the method. It is called when an instance of the class is created. At the time of calling constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory.It is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object.

Example:In this example, we are creating the no-arg constructor in the Bike class. It will be invoked at the time of object creation.

```javascript
//Java Program to create and call a default constructor  
class Bike1{  
//creating a default constructor  
Bike1(){System.out.println("Bike is created");}  
//main method  
public static void main(String args[]){  
//calling a default constructor  
Bike1 b=new Bike1();  
}  
}  
```

Output: Bike is created

## 2. a) Write a program to show the usages of various data types in java.

Ans:

```javascript
public class datatypes {
        public static void main(String args[])
        {
            //primitive data types
            byte id=5;
            int rank=700;
            char grade='A';
            boolean result=true;
            long phno=945105130;
            short wardno=2;
            //non-primitive data types
            int arr[]={1,5,56,41,5};
            String name="Hari KC";
            System.out.println("ID:" +id + "\nName:" + name + "\nRank:" + rank +"\nGrade:"+ grade +"\nPhoneno:" + phno +"\nWardno: "+ wardno +  "\nResult: " + result );
        }
}
```

Output:

```javascript
ID:5
Name:Hari KC
Rank:700
Grade:A
Phoneno:945105130
Wardno: 2
Result: true
```

## 2. b) ) Define Inheritance. Write a program which has two classes A and B, where A should act as Parent class and B should inherit from A.

Ans:Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).
Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.

```javascript
class A {
    //parent class
    void display(){
        System.out.println("This is parent class");
    }
}
class B extends A{
    //child class
    void show(){
        System.out.println("This is child class");
    }
}
class Testinheritance{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        B obj= new B();
        obj.display();
        obj.show();
    }
}
```

Output:
This is parent class

This is child class

## 3. a) Define Exception handling with Example

Ans: An exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program i.e at run time, that disrupts the normal flow of the program’s instructions.
The Exception Handling in Java is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors so that normal flow of the application can be maintained.

Example: Program to illustrate handling arithemetic exception.

```javascript
public class JavaExceptionExample{  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
   try{  
      //code that may raise exception  
      int data=100/0;  
   }catch(ArithmeticException e){System.out.println(e);}  
   //rest code of the program
   System.out.println("rest of the code...");  
  }  
}
```  

## 3. b)Create a Frame which has three textfield and one button. When user clicks on button it should calculate sum of the value of first and second textfield and display on third textfield.

Ans:

```javascript
import javax.swing.*;  
import java.awt.event.*;  
public class TextFieldExample implements ActionListener{  
    JTextField tf1,tf2,tf3;  
    JButton b1,b2;  
    TextFieldExample(){  
        JFrame f= new JFrame();  
        tf1=new JTextField();  
        tf1.setBounds(50,50,150,20);  
        tf2=new JTextField();  
        tf2.setBounds(50,100,150,20);  
        tf3=new JTextField();  
        tf3.setBounds(50,150,150,20);  
        tf3.setEditable(false);
        b1=new JButton("+");  
        b1.setBounds(50,200,50,50);  
        b2=new JButton("-");  
        b2.setBounds(120,200,50,50);  
        b1.addActionListener(this);  
        b2.addActionListener(this);  
        f.add(tf1);f.add(tf2);f.add(tf3);f.add(b1);f.add(b2);  
        f.setSize(300,300);  
        f.setLayout(null);  
        f.setVisible(true);  
    }
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {  
        String s1=tf1.getText();  
        String s2=tf2.getText();  
        int a=Integer.parseInt(s1);  
        int b=Integer.parseInt(s2);  
        int c=0;  
        if(e.getSource()==b1){  
            c=a+b;  
        }else if(e.getSource()==b2){  
            c=a-b;  
        }  
        String result=String.valueOf(c);  
        tf3.setText(result);  
    }  
public static void main(String[] args) {  
    new TextFieldExample();  
} }  
```

Output:

## 4. a) What is difference between Interface and Class? Explain with an example.

Ans:

CLASS | INTERFACE
------|----------
The keyword used to create a class is “class” | The keyword used to create an interface is “interface”
A class can be instantiated i.e, objects of a class can be created. | An Inteface cannot be instantiated i.e, objects cannot be created.
Classes does not support multiple inheritance. | Inteface supports multiple inheritance.
It can be inherit another class. | It cannot inherit a class.
It can be inherited by another class using the keyword ‘extends’. | It can be inherited by a class by using the keyword ‘implements’ and it can be inherited by an interface using the keyword ‘extends’.
It can contain constructors. | It cannot contain constructors.
It cannot contain abstract methods. | It contains abstract methods only.
Variables and methods in a class can be declared using any access specifier(public, private, default, protected) | All variables and methods in a interface are declared as public.
Variables in a class can be static, final or neither. | All variables are static and final.

## 4. b)Write a program to read content from file "abc.txt" and store it in "xyz.txt".

Ans:

## 5. a)What are applets? Define Applet life cycle with Example.

Ans:An applet is a Java program that can be embedded into a web page. It runs inside the web browser and works at client side. An applet is embedded in an HTML page using the APPLET or OBJECT tag and hosted on a web server.

When an applet is executed within the web browser or in an applet window, it goes through the four stages of its life cycle: initialized, started, stopped and destroyed. These stages correspond to the applet methods init(), start(), stop() and destroy() respectively. All these methods defined in the Applet class which is called automatically by the browser or the applet viewer controlling the applet. All these methods have hollow bodies by default. To perform specific functions, these methods need to be overridden in the user's applet so that the browser can call your code correctly.

![Applet life cycle](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Java-Applet-Lifecycle.png)

```javascript
  
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.Graphics;
  
// HelloWorld class extends Applet
public class HelloWorld extends Applet  
{
    // Overriding paint() method
    @Override
    public void paint(Graphics g)  
    {
        g.drawString("Hello World", 20, 20);
    }

}
```

## 5. b) Write a program to send "Message from Pokhara University" from client to server using java socket programming.

Ans:

## 6. a)Define JDBC. Write a program to update data on following table.

```javascript
Table: student
Column: NAME TYPE
id number
name varchar
age number
```

Ans: JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity. JDBC is a Java API to connect and execute the query with the database. It is a part of JavaSE (Java Standard Edition).

## 6. b) What is the difference between Frame and Swing?

Ans:
Frame(AWT) | Swing
-----------|------
AWT stands for Abstract windows toolkit. | Swing is also called as JFC’s (Java Foundation classes).
AWT components are called Heavyweight component. | Swings are called light weight component because swing components sits on the top of AWT components and do the work.
AWT components require java.awt package. | Swing components require javax.swing package.
AWT components are platform dependent. | Swing components are made in purely java and they are platform independent.
This feature is not supported in AWT. | We can have different look and feel in Swing.
These feature is not available in AWT. | Swing has many advanced features like JTabel, Jtabbed pane which is not available in AWT. Also. Swing components are called "lightweight" because they do not require a native OS object to implement their functionality. JDialog and JFrame are heavyweight, because they do have a peer. So components like JButton, JTextArea, etc., are lightweight because they do not have an OS peer.
With AWT, you have 21 "peers" (one for each control and one for the dialog itself). A "peer" is a widget provided by the operating system, such as a button object or an entry field object. | With Swing, you would have only one peer, the operating system's window object. All of the buttons, entry fields, etc. are drawn by the Swing package on the drawing surface provided by the window object. This is the reason that Swing has more code. It has to draw the button or other control and implement its behavior instead of relying on the host operating system to perform those functions.
AWT is a thin layer of code on top of the OS. | Swing is much larger. Swing also has very much richer functionality.
Using AWT, you have to implement a lot of things yourself. | Swing has them built in.

## 7. Short notes on:

### 1. JRE

A software program needs to execute, and to do that it needs an environment to run in. The runtime environment loads class files and ensures there is access to memory and other system resources to run them. In the past, most software used the operating system (OS) as its runtime environment.

JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.The Java Runtime Environment is a software layer that runs on top of a computer's operating system, providing additional services specific to Java.
The JRE smoothes over the diversity of operating systems, ensuring that Java programs can run on virtually any OS without modification. It also provides value-added services. Automatic memory management is one of the JRE's most important services, ensuring that programmers don't have to manually control the allocation and reallocation of memory.

In short, the JRE is a sort of meta-OS for Java programs. It's a classic example of abstraction, abstracting the underlying operating system into a consistent platform for running Java applications.

A Java Virtual Machine is a running software system responsible for executing live Java programs. The JRE is the on-disk system that takes your Java code, combines it with the necessary libraries, and starts the JVM to execute it.

### 2. Event Handling

Event Handling is the mechanism that controls the event and decides what should happen if an event occurs. This mechanism have the code which is known as event handler that is executed when an event occurs. Java Uses the Delegation Event Model to handle the events. This model defines the standard mechanism to generate and handle the events.Let's have a brief introduction to this model.

The Delegation Event Model has the following key participants namely:

- Source - The source is an object on which event occurs. Source is responsible for providing information of the occurred event to it's handler. Java provide as with classes for source object.

- Listener - It is also known as event handler.Listener is responsible for generating response to an event. From java implementation point of view the listener is also an object. Listener waits until it receives an event. Once the event is received , the listener process the event an then returns.

The benefit of this approach is that the user interface logic is completely separated from the logic that generates the event. The user interface element is able to delegate the processing of an event to the separate piece of code. In this model ,Listener needs to be registered with the source object so that the listener can receive the event notification. This is an efficient way of handling the event because the event notifications are sent only to those listener that want to receive them.

### 3.Result set

A ResultSet object maintains a cursor that points to the current row in the result set. The term "result set" refers to the row and column data contained in a ResultSet object.

The methods of the ResultSet interface can be broken down into three categories −

- Navigational methods: Used to move the cursor around.

- Get methods: Used to view the data in the columns of the current row being pointed by the cursor.

- Update methods: Used to update the data in the columns of the current row. The updates can then be updated in the underlying database as well.
